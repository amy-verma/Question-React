What are the features of React?
1. Component-Based Architecture

- UI is built from reusable components.
- Each component manages its own state and can be reused across the app.

2. Virtual DOM
- React uses a Virtual DOM to optimize updates.
- Changes are first made in memory, then efficiently updated in the real DOM (only where necessary).
- Improves performance, especially in complex UIs.

3. One-Way Data Binding
- Data flows in one direction: from parent to child components.
- Makes data flow predictable and debugging easier.

4. JSX (JavaScript XML)
- A syntax extension that lets you write HTML inside JavaScript.
- Looks like HTML, but allows embedding dynamic expressions.

5. Declarative UI
- You describe what the UI should look like, and React handles how to render it.
- This makes code easier to read and debug.

6. State Management
 - Each component can have its own state.
 - React also integrates with tools like Redux, Context API, or Recoil for managing global state.

7. Hooks API (from React 16.8+)
- Hooks like useState, useEffect, and useContext allow using state and lifecycle features in functional components.

8. Developer Tools
- React DevTools browser extension helps with:
- Inspecting component trees
- Tracking state and props

9. Cross-Platform with React Native
- React code can be used to build mobile apps via React Native.
- Shared logic between web and mobile platforms.

10. Rich Ecosystem
- React Router for routing
- Axios or Fetch for HTTP requests
- Tailwind or Styled Components for styling
